# Errors & guarantees

Lyra is **fail-closed**: at query time, bad input means empty results, never an exception. Build and load validate up front and throw on structurally broken bundles. The split is deliberate. You find config mistakes when you build, and a typo in a live query degrades to "no matches" instead of crashing a request.

## What throws

### `createBundle`

| Cause | Message |
|---|---|
| `kind` not `id`/`facet`/`range`/`meta`/`alias` | `Invalid field kind "foo" for field "status". …` |
| `type` not `string`/`number`/`boolean`/`date` | `Invalid field type "foo" for field "status". …` |
| Range field (simple config) holds a value that's neither number nor parseable date | `Cannot infer range type for field "createdAt". …` |

A configured field that exists on no item doesn't throw. It warns once and is otherwise ignored (present in the manifest, no indexed values).

### `LyraBundle.load` / `loadBinary`

Throws on a bundle that can't be trusted:

- Missing `manifest` or `items` → `Invalid bundle JSON: missing manifest or items`
- Version not starting `"3."` or `"4."` → `Invalid bundle version: "2.0.0". Expected version starting with "3." or "4."`
- `capabilities` names a field that isn't in `fields` → `… capability references non-existent facet field "status"`
- `facetIndex` keys a field that isn't in `capabilities.facets` → `… facetIndex contains field "priority" that is not in capabilities.facets`
- Binary buffer with a bad `LYRA4` magic, oversized header, or out-of-bounds block offsets

A facet declared in `capabilities` but absent from `facetIndex` is fine: it initializes empty, and queries on it return nothing. That's the valid state for a field where every value is null. The [bundle spec](./bundle-json-spec.md#error-cases) lists every binary-format error.

## What fails closed (query)

`query` normalizes instead of throwing:

| Input | Result |
|---|---|
| Unknown `equal` / `ranges` field | `total: 0`, `items: []`; the unknown field stays in `applied` |
| Negative `offset` | clamped to `0` |
| Negative `limit` | `0` items returned; `total` still counts all matches |
| `limit` larger than the match count | clamped to what's available |

Unknown fields failing closed is the point: a mistyped facet name returns nothing rather than silently dropping the filter and over-returning. Check `total === 0` to catch it.

Bad *types* in a query (an object where a scalar belongs) are out of scope. Pass structurally valid `LyraQuery` shapes; TypeScript covers this.

## Guarantees

- **Deterministic.** Same bundle + same query → same result. No randomness, no time-dependence.
- **Immutable.** Querying never mutates the bundle or anything else. Every query against a bundle sees one consistent snapshot.
- **Inclusive ranges.** `min`/`max` bounds include the endpoints. Dates are epoch ms (or strings via `Date.parse()`); unparseable values drop out.
- **Null handling.** `null`/`undefined` are excluded from the facet index and from range results. They're tracked separately so `isNull` and `equal: { f: [v, null] }` stay fast.
- **Multi-valued facets.** An array facet value matches if *any* element matches.
